It is a nosql type database
It uses UDP for transfering data between the  server and clint 
It can be used to store the variables and later share it with two different programs running parallelly
First run the server with giving an input constraint as port number which must be greater than 1024
Then add the clint.h header file
The use database as a class for communication  
use database.connect to connect(port_no ) and  connect(ip_address , port_no ) to connect with  any database running  on the same system  and on different system vice versa
